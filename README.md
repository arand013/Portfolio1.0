* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
1. WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
2. WHEN I click one of the links in the navigations

* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4. WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
5. WHEN I click on the images of the applications
* THEN I am taken to that deployed application
6. WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
